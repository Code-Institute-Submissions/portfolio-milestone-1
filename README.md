# *- EVS operator & editor -*
# **porfolio**

User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute
– **First Milestone Project** 

This project is a portfolio designed for my own business. The main goal was to create online presence, showcasing some of the projects I worked on and invite potential clients to get in touch and discuss work opportunities.

The way EVS operators/video editors receive job offers is usually through the word of mouth and past experiences. For those reasons I wanted to create a clear and simple to navigate page,  visually aesthetic with as little big blocks of text as possible.

# UX

Main goal, following the industry standards, was to make website easily accessible, include all information required while keeping minimalistic design.

A lot of potential employers/clients would most likely already know what kind of person they are looking for, for those reasons it was important to have interesting landing page and eye-grabbing “projects” section which included little glimpse into my career.
Additionally I added “contact me” section where people can get in touch if they have any queries.
Lastly I provided downloadable CV for employer to have an option to look over it further. It also has a bit more details (past work experiences and skills)
I also included links to outside sources like my LinkedIn account and Instagram and of course the downloadable CV for their ease of access. It is quite unconventional to have those listed on landing page, but I do think it works with the design and might be beneficial for potential clients.

## Features

There are 5 key sections in this website:

 - landing page
 - about me
 - projects
 - contact
 - downloadable CV
 
Each section has a responsive design and has navigation bar with logo to the left (which is also linked to landing page) and other menu items to the right that take you to each section accordingly.
At the bottom there is a footer which include copyright and social media icons.

*Landing page*

Home page includes my logo, title and links to social media on the right hand side. On the left you will find an image from my work environment.
As mentioned before, its not conventional to have social media icons at the top of the website, but looking at past experiences, I believe potential clients would appreciate fast glance on my CV or LinkedIn. 

*about me*

I decided to include a bit of information about me and list couple of my biggest jobs so far.  Experiences speak far more than words and I believe people visiting my portfolio would appreciate that. 
As per course requirements I also included video file, which shows another EVS operator at work. Unfortunately for the lack of possibility to access my own videos, I included one from youtube.

*projects*

As per advice, I focused on 4 highlight points of my career with short explanation. I also included possibility for "read more" if someone wished to check specific section further. 

*contact me*

Simple form that allows for clients to get easily in touch with any queries. All fields are mandatory.

*cv*

CV opens as PDF document in new tab (allows people download the file and take it away)

**Features to implement** 

In the future, I would like to add further projects that I've worked on to create a more comprehensive project section. I would also look to add more animation to some sections when I advance more with languages. 
Hopefully I will also be able to add my own videos when I travel back home - if I was to use this page commercially I would have to swap youtube video.
