User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute
– **First Milestone Project** 

This project is a portfolio designed for my own business. The main goal was to create online presence, showcasing some of the projects I worked on and invite potential clients to get in touch and discuss work opportunities.

The way EVS operators/video editors receive job offers is usually through the word of mouth and past experiences. For those reasons I wanted to create a clear and simple to navigate page,  visually aesthetic with as little big blocks of text as possible.

# UX

Main goal, following the industry standards, was to make website easily accessible, include all information required while keeping minimalistic design.

A lot of potential employers/clients would most likely already know what kind of person they are looking for, for those reasons it was important to have interesting landing page and eye-grabbing “projects” section which included little glimpse into my career.
Additionally I added “contact me” section where people can get in touch if they have any queries.
Lastly I provided downloadable CV for employer to have an option to look over it further. It also has a bit more details (past work experiences and skills)
I also included links to outside sources like my LinkedIn account and Instagram and of course the downloadable CV for their ease of access. It is quite unconventional to have those listed on landing page, but I do think it works with the design and might be beneficial for potential clients.

## Features

There are 5 key sections in this website:

 - landing page
 - about me
 - projects
 - contact
 - downloadable CV
 
Each section has a responsive design and has navigation bar with logo to the left (which is also linked to landing page) and other menu items to the right that take you to each section accordingly.
At the bottom there is a footer which include copyright and social media icons.
